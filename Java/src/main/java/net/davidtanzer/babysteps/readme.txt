Run through the whole kata.

First we need rough tests (70')
* Ctrl+Shift+T -> navigate/create new test
* Singleton class is a problem, Grrr. Need all tests in one because I cannot reset the Singleton.

Now we can make it more testable - that is faster tests (15')
* extract System.currentTimeMillis with tool, move it to class
* not entirely automated, part in uncovered code was automated.
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T -> refactor this

Add fast tests.
